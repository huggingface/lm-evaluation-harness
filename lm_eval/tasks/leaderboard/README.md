# Leaderboard evaluations
Our goal with this group is to create an unchanging through time version of evaluations that will power the Open LLM Leaderboard on HuggingFace.

As we want to evaluate models across capabilities, the list currently contains:
- BBH
- GPQA (0-shot, multichoice)
- Math (minerva version, compatible with few-shot)
